The `reports` and `temp` directories are created here when the accessibility suite is executed however none of these files will be committed to GitHub.

- The `reports` directory will contain reports of any failing tests and will also contain a copy of the HTML template which failed the accessibility test.
- The `temp` directory is used to store temporary files generated during the `pa11y` accessibility test process.
